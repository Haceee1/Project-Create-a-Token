# MyToken

## Project Title
Create a Token

## Description
MyToken is a basic implementation of an ERC20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. This smart contract allows for the minting and burning of tokens, which can be used as a foundation for more complex token interactions and applications. The token is named "META" with the abbreviation "MTA".

## Getting Started

### Installing
To get started with MyToken using Remix Ethereum IDE, follow these steps:

1. **Open Remix:**
   Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org).

2. **Create a New File:**
   - In the Remix IDE, create a new file named `MyToken.sol`.

3. **Copy the Contract Code:**
   - Copy and paste the following Solidity code into `MyToken.sol`:

     ```solidity
     // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
     // This comment specifies the license under which the code is distributed. Here, it's the MIT license.
     
     pragma solidity 0.8.18;
     // This line sets the version of the Solidity compiler to use, specified as 0.8.18.
     
     contract MyToken {
     // This line declares a Solidity contract named `MyToken`. Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented programming languages. They encapsulate data (state variables) and functions that operate on that data.

         // public variables here
         string public tokenName = "META";
         string public tokenAbbrv = "MTA";
         uint public totalSupply = 0;
         // The "tokenName," with the value of META, and "tokenAbbrv," with the value of MTA, are public variables that store the token's name and abbreviation, respectively. As public strings, their values are accessible to anyone interacting with the contract.
         // "totalSupply" is a public variable that stores the total number of tokens available. It's an unsigned integer (uint) and can be accessed both within and outside the contract.

         // mapping variable here
         mapping(address => uint) public balances;
         // The "balances" mapping links Ethereum addresses to their respective token balances. Ethereum addresses act as unique identifiers for users on the network. This mapping allows efficient storage and retrieval of token balances for each address.

         // mint function
         function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
           totalSupply += _value;
           balances[_address] += _value;
         }
         // The "Mint" function lets the contract owner create new tokens and assign them to a specified address. It takes two parameters: "_address," the recipient address, and "_value," the number of tokens to mint. This function increases the total token supply and credits the minted tokens to the given address.
         
         // burn function
         function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
           if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
              totalSupply -= _value;
              balances[_address] -= _value;
           }
         }
         // Conversely, the "Burn" function allows token holders to destroy their tokens. It requires two parameters: "_address," the address from which tokens will be burned, and "_value," the number of tokens to burn. This function checks if the sender has enough tokens to burn. If so, it decreases the total token supply and deducts the burned tokens from the specified address's balance.

     }
     ```

### Executing Program

#### How to run the program
1. **Compile the Contract:**
   - In the Remix IDE, navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left panel.
   - Select the appropriate compiler version (0.8.18).
   - Click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.
   - *First, let's compile the code. If you choose auto-compile, you don't need to do this manually.*

2. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - After successful compilation, navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, or another).
   - Click on the "Deploy" button under the "Deploy" section.
   - *Under the Solidity compiler, in the deploy and run transactions section, choose the Remix VM (Paris) environment and keep the default settings.
Press the deploy button and scroll down to find the deployed contract. You'll see all the functions and variables we've discussed: burn, mint, balances, tokenAbbrv, tokenName, and totalSupply.*

3. **Interact with the Contract:**
   - Once deployed, the contract will appear under the "Deployed Contracts" section.
   - You can interact with the contract functions (mint and burn) directly from the Remix UI.
   - To test the mint function, click the copy button next to the account, paste it into the address field, and set the value to 3000.
Click the totalSupply button to check if the value is stored. If it's there, the function works correctly.
Check the balance by pasting the account address and pressing call to see if the balance is updated.
Test the burn function similarly: paste the account address and enter the value you want to burn. Call the totalSupply function to see if the value is deducted. Check the balance to confirm the deduction.
Try burning more tokens than the balance. Repeat the process and observe that the balance and total supply do not change, indicating that the contract works correctly.*

With these steps, you should have MyToken deployed and ready to interact with on the Remix Ethereum IDE, allowing you to mint and burn tokens as per your requirements.

## Conclusion
In summary, we've dissected the code, uncovering how tokens are created and managed in Solidity. With this understanding, you're ready to dive deeper into decentralized application development. Keep coding, keep exploring, and let's keep building toward a decentralized future!
